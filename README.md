# SurveyForm
This Survey Form was made in FreeCodeCamp resposive web design course

It is not responsive as I haven't learnt responsiveness yet, but when I will learn it, I'll update this webpage and make it responsive as well

I'm new to git so I've pushed the code in it but I don't know anything else
I don't know how someone can run the code and see the webpage in github itself.

If you know please help me

Thank you!

P.S. Just learnt about github pages deployment and did it, now everyone can see this webpage. yayy!!
